                                            ATTACK ON TITAN!!!

This isn't your typical Whack-A-Mole game...
Everyone has probably seen whack-a-mole but now the moles are titans. The goal is to whack(attack) as many titans as you can without attacking a fellow scout.

Before you start you should toggle the help button (?). . . Once the game starts this button will no longer be available, so make sure you have a firm grasp of all the rules.

# ATTACK ON TITAN!!!

This isn't your typical Whack-A-Mole game... 

Everyone has probably seen whack-a-mole but now the moles are titans. The goal is to whack(attack) as many titans as you can without attacking a fellow scout.

Rules
Before you start you should toggle the help button (?). . .  


Once the game starts this button will no longer be available, so make sure you have a firm grasp of all the rules.

    * To 'attack' a Titan you must click on them.

    * Each time you defeat a titan you will have 10 points added to your score.

    * If you attack a fellow scout then the game is over.

    * There is a 2:00 time limit for this game.

    * See how many titans you can take down before it's all said and done!
